### Overview

Twitch is the world’s leading live streaming platform for gamers, with over 7 million monthly streamers and 30 million daily users as of February 2021, and is operated by a subsidiary of Amazon.com, Inc. One of the most important features of Twitch is its chat functionality which provides streamers the ability to easily interact with their viewers who communicate via text and, in many cases, can be used as an indicator of the overall quality of the content being provided. While Twitch provides its own analytics page with access to things like average viewers, unique viewers, unique chatters, and many other useful statistics, they provide nothing with regards to Twitch chat message content in aggregate.

The Twitch Chat Sentiment Analysis and Data Visualization Dashboard is an application similar to that of Twitch’s Channel Analytics page, but with a focus instead on the sentiment analysis of Twitch chat. This application gives streamers even more insight into how the content they’re providing is being interpreted by their audience, and allows them to make better business decisions in the future as a result.

This application provides a number of different options, allowing retrieval of messages given a time range, dynamic data viewing over a selected time frame, and a detailed breakdown of the sentiment analysis model used to analyze messages. Additionally, the user is provided the ability to export the currently displayed data in csv format for further analysis.
